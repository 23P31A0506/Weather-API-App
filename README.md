# Weather-API-App
This Weather API App is built using Python and the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows users to input a city name and retrieve the current weather and temperature in Fahrenheit. The program checks if the city exists and displays an error message if it is not found. It uses the requests library to fetch and handle live weather data.
